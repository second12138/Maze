To run the Prolog program : swipl ./maze_prolog.pl <input file name> <output file name>

For example, "swipl ./maze_prolog.pl maze output" would run the program with binary file named maze and ouput a file named output.

*Note: When solve a maze with length higher than 100, it will give a warning:'Warning: maze:1:1: Illegal UTF-8 continuation', but it will continue run the solving file. Just takes longer time to solve.
